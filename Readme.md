Extremely simple subscription payment form with Stripe in seconds.

Great for charging {{someone}} for a monthly subscription to {{something}}.

Try out the demo at <http://substripe.com/demo> (enter credit card 4242-4242-4242-4242 with any valid exp date and any CVC).

> View this documentation at <http://documentup.com/niftylettuce/substripe>.


## Quick Start

1. Create a new Stripe subscription plan at <https://manage.stripe.com/plans> (create identical plans in both Live and Test mode).
2. Configure Stripe to automatically [send emails upon successful payments](https://manage.stripe.com/account/emails).
3. Install `substripe` as a global module with NPM:
```bash
npm install -g substripe
```
4. Spin up a server in either development or production mode (see below).

### Environment Variables

Here are the following environment variables and their default values.

| Environment Variable | Default Value   | Description
| -------------------- | --------------- | -----------
| SK                   | None (required) | Stripe secret key
| PK                   | None (required) | Stripe public key
| PUBLIC               | `./`            | Path to public directory for serving assets (e.g. Stripe Checkout image, see below [Tricks](#tricks))
| PORT                 | 3000            | Port to run substripe server on
| NODE_ENV             | development (if value is "production", then PORT is set to 443) | Node.js environment (either "development" or "production")

### Development Mode

```bash
PUBLIC=./ PORT=3000 SK=stripe-test-sk PK=stripe-test-pk
```

<http://localhost:3000/plan/{{stripe_plan_id}}>

### Production Mode

Register a domain name and an SSL certificate (e.g. PositiveSSL or RapidSSL) at [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=34556) (affiliate link, you can use coupon "DOMAINZZ" as of Feb 7, 2014 to save some bones).

Port is automatically set to 443 (https protocol) in production mode (as required by Stripe), so you don't need to pass `PORT` environment variable like in development mode (see above).

```bash
NODE_ENV=production PUBLIC=./ SK=stripe-live-sk PK=stripe-live-pk substripe
```

<https://yourdomain.com/plan/{{stripe_plan_id}}>


## Tricks

You can add the following options as querystring parameters to pre-populate the Stripe checkout form.  These options are the same the [Configuration Options](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout#integration-simple-options) from Stripe.

> (e.g. pre-populate an image and an email address of the customer <https://yourdomain.com/{{stripe_plan_id}}?image=substripe.png&email=niftylettuce@gmail.com>)

| Param            | Default Value
| ---------------- | --------------
| image            | "substripe.png"
| name             | [display name]
| description      | "Subscribe to {{plan.name}}"
| amount           | {{plan.amount}} (cents)
| currency         | "usd"
| panel_label      | "Subscribe @ ${{plan.amount}}/{{plan.interval}}"
| billing_address  | false
| shipping_address | false
| email            | ""
| label            | "Subscribe @ ${{plan.amount}}/{{plan.interval}}"

**NOTE**: Default value's for `panel_label` and `label` have the values of {{plan.interval}} abbreviated (e.g. "week" => "wk", "month" => "mo", "year" => "yr").
